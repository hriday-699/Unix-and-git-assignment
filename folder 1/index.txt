"Content" can mean the information, ideas, or subject matter contained within a medium like a book or website, or it can refer to the things held inside a container. In a digital context, it is any form of information designed to engage an audience, such as blog posts, videos, or podcasts. A different, but related, meaning of the word is the adjective "content," which means satisfied or happy.
